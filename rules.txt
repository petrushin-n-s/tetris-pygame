Tetriminos are game pieces shaped like tetrominoes, geometric shapes 
composed of four square blocks each.
A random sequence of Tetriminos fall down the playing field 
(a rectangular vertical shaft, called the "well" or "matrix"). 
The objective of the game is to manipulate these Tetriminos, by 
moving each one sideways and/or rotating by quarter-turns, so that 
they form a solid horizontal line without gaps. 
When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it 
fall down to fill the space. 
When a certain number of lines are cleared, the game enters a new level.
As the game progresses, each level causes the Tetriminos to fall faster,
and the game ends when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of 
the playing field and no new Tetriminos are able to enter. 
Some games also end after a finite number of levels or lines.
